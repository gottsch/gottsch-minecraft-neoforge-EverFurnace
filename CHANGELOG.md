## [3.2.0] - 2026-06-22

### ✨ Added

- **Brewing stands now keep brewing while you're away.** Leave potions brewing,
  wander off far enough that the area stops ticking, and when you come back any
  brews that would have finished are done — with a little burst of particles and a
  quick message telling you how many brews finished. This shines for automated,
  hopper-fed brewing setups, which can finish many brews during one long trip.
- A new setting, **brewingStandCatchupEnabled** (on by default), lets you turn
  brewing catch-up off on its own while still catching up furnaces and campfires.

---

## [3.1.0] - 2026-06-04

### 🛠️ Fixed

- Furnaces added by other mods — the kind that are built on top of the vanilla
  furnace — now catch up on their cooking while you're away again. After the 3.0
  update a few of these had quietly stopped catching up; they're back to working
  like normal furnaces.

### ✨ Added

- Other mods can now sign up a whole family of cooking blocks for catch-up at
  once, instead of registering each block type one at a time. This makes it
  easier for other mods to add EverFurnace support.

---

## [3.0.0] - 2026-06-01

### 🎉 Highlights

#### Other Mods Can Now Use EverFurnace Catch-Up
- EverFurnace now has a public API that lets other mods add the same offline
  catch-up behaviour to their own cooking blocks.
- If a mod registers its cooking block with EverFurnace, players will get the
  same "finished while you were away" experience for that block as they do for
  vanilla furnaces and campfires — particle burst, chat notification, the works.
- The first planned expansion using this is **EverFurnace: Farmer's Delight**,
  which will bring catch-up to the Cooking Pot.

#### Vanilla Cooking Blocks Now Use the Same System Internally
- Furnaces, Blast Furnaces, Smokers, and Campfires all go through the new API
  behind the scenes. Nothing changes for players — this just makes the whole mod
  cleaner and easier to maintain.

### ⚙️ Changed

- No config changes. All existing settings work exactly as before.

---

## [2.3.0] - 2026-05-29

### ✨ Added

- **Campfires keep cooking while you're away** — put food on a lit campfire (regular
  or soul campfire), wander off far enough that the area goes to sleep, and the
  campfire remembers what it was doing. When you come back, it catches up on the time
  it missed and finishes any food that should be done by now, with a little puff of
  flames and smoke so you can see it happened.
  - Each spot on the campfire only cooks the one item you placed and doesn't refill
    itself, so you'll never come back to a surprise pile of food.
  - The catch-up only happens once you're close enough to see it.
  - You can turn this off or set a limit on how much time it catches up in the
    settings, the same way you already can for furnaces.

---

## [2.2.0] - 2026-04-28

### ✨ Added

- **Admin commands** — `/everfurnace inspect [x y z]`, `/everfurnace tick <radius>`,
  `/everfurnace simulate <radius> <ticks>`. Require permission level 2.
  - `inspect` shows the stored EverFurnace NBT state (lastGameTime, delta,
    pendingNotification, pendingXp) and whether catch-up would fire on the next tick.
  - `tick` forces `serverTick` on every loaded furnace within the given radius,
    triggering catch-up immediately. Positions are snapshotted before iteration to
    avoid concurrent-modification hazards.
  - `simulate` backdates `lastGameTime` by the given number of ticks on every loaded
    furnace within the given radius (radius guard prevents accidental dimension-wide
    backdating). Follow with `tick` to apply catch-up instantly during testing.

### 🐛 Fixed

- **Vanilla clients can now connect to servers running EverFurnace** — the catch-up
  particle packet is now registered as `.optional()`, so unmodded clients skip it
  silently instead of disconnecting.
- **Dedicated server classloading safety** — `CatchupParticlePacket` now holds the
  registered handler method and gates execution behind a `FMLEnvironment.dist` check,
  preventing the `@OnlyIn(CLIENT)` `CatchupParticleHandler` class from being touched
  on dedicated server distributions.
- `neoforge.mods.toml` now declares `side="SERVER"` — NeoForge will not require
  clients to have the mod installed to join a server running it.

---

## [2.1.0] - 2026-03-29

### 🎉 Highlights

#### XP Catch-Up
- XP that would have been awarded during offline smelting is no longer silently lost.
- EverFurnace accumulates owed XP during each catch-up pass and awards it the next
  time the player opens the furnace.
- Fractional XP values (e.g. iron ore awards 0.7 XP per item) are handled correctly —
  the remainder carries over across multiple opens until it tips over a whole point.

#### Login Notifications
- On multiplayer servers, pending furnace notifications are now delivered on player
  login rather than only when the player physically opens each furnace.
- If multiple furnaces have pending notifications, a single summary message is sent:
  `[EverFurnace] 3 furnaces cooked a combined 96 items while you were away.`
- Controlled by the new `notifyOnLogin` config key (default `true`).

#### Notification Cooldown
- Rapid chunk-load/unload cycles can no longer flood chat with repeated notifications.
- Notifications from the same furnace are batched until the cooldown window expires.
- Items cooked during the cooldown are never dropped — they accumulate into the
  existing pending count and are delivered together.
- Controlled by `notificationCooldownTicks` (default `200` / 10 seconds).

#### Sound Cue
- A furnace crackle sound plays at the furnace position when catch-up completes and
  at least one item was cooked, giving an audio cue alongside the particle burst.
- Client-side only. Can be disabled via `soundCueEnabled` in `everfurnace-client.toml`.

#### Light State Snap
- The furnace block's LIT state is now immediately synced on the client when catch-up
  completes, so the local light level updates without waiting for the next server
  block-update packet.
- Client-side only. Can be disabled via `lightFlickerEnabled` in `everfurnace-client.toml`.

### ⚙️ Changed

- **`everfurnace-common.toml`** — two new keys in the `notifications` section:
    - `notificationCooldownTicks` (long, default `200`, range `0–72 000`)
    - `notifyOnLogin` (boolean, default `true`)
- **`everfurnace-client.toml`** — two new keys in the `visuals` section:
    - `soundCueEnabled` (boolean, default `true`)
    - `lightFlickerEnabled` (boolean, default `true`)

---

## [2.0.1] - 2026-03-26

### 🐛 Fixed

- **Dedicated server crash on startup** — `CatchupParticlePacket` referenced `Minecraft`
  (a client-only class) directly in its packet handler. On a dedicated server, Forge
  attempted to load the class during packet registration and threw a
  `BootstrapMethodError` with `Attempted to load class ... for invalid dist DEDICATED_SERVER`.
  Fixed by splitting client-side particle logic into a separate `CatchupParticleHandler`
  class annotated `@OnlyIn(Dist.CLIENT)`, and delegating to it from the packet via
  `DistExecutor.unsafeRunWhenOn(Dist.CLIENT, ...)` so the server never touches client
  classes.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-03-24

### 🎉 Highlights

#### Catch-Up Mechanic — Core Overhaul
- Furnaces now correctly simulate fuel consumption and cooking progress for time elapsed
  while the chunk was unloaded or the server was offline.
- Results are delivered instantly when the chunk reloads — no waiting for each item to
  cook individually.
- Applies to all three vanilla furnace types: Furnace, Smoker, and Blast Furnace.

#### Forge Config API
- Key catch-up parameters are now tunable via config files without touching code.
- `everfurnace-common.toml` — server-side settings: master toggle, catch-up tick cap,
  delta threshold, and player notification toggle.
- `everfurnace-client.toml` — client-side settings: particle burst toggle.

#### Offline Progress Notification
- When a player opens a furnace that cooked items while they were away, a chat message
  is sent showing the number of items processed.
- Example: `[EverFurnace] Your furnace cooked 32 items while you were away.`
- Can be disabled per-server via `notifyPlayerOnCatchup` in `everfurnace-common.toml`.

#### Visual Flame Particle Burst
- A brief burst of flame and smoke particles spawns at the furnace position when
  catch-up completes and at least one item was cooked.
- Client-side only — no server impact.
- Can be disabled via `particleBurstEnabled` in `everfurnace-client.toml`.

### 🐛 Fixed

- **Operator bug** — `=+` / `=-` used throughout the tick method instead of `+=` / `-=`,
  causing wildly incorrect `litTime` and `cookingProgress` values on every catch-up pass.
- **Cook time reset** — `cookingTotalTime -= cookingTotalTime` always resolved to `0`,
  silently zeroing out the cook time instead of resetting only the progress counter.
- **Double fuel shrink** — After consuming whole fuel items, a second unconditional
  `shrink(1)` fired and could corrupt the fuel stack item count.
- **Spurious catch-up on first light** — `lastGameTime` initialised to `0` caused
  `deltaTime` to equal the entire world age on the first tick, triggering a massive
  unintended catch-up burst.
- **Unbounded catch-up loop** — No upper limit on simulated ticks meant long offline
  periods could cause a server lag spike on chunk load.
- **Missing `setChanged`** — Inventory changes and cooking progress updates during
  catch-up were not marked dirty, causing them to not sync to clients or persist reliably.

### ⚙️ Changed

- **Delta threshold** — Catch-up now only fires when the tick gap meets or exceeds the
  configured `minDeltaThreshold` (default 20 ticks / 1 second). Below this the furnace
  is considered actively ticking and vanilla handles smelting normally.
- **Catch-up cap** — Simulated time is capped at `maxCatchupTicks` (default 24 000 /
  1 in-game day) per load event to prevent lag spikes after extended offline periods.

### 🔧 Technical / Developer Notes

- `onTick` refactored into two private static helpers: `applyFuelTime()` and
  `applyCookTime()`. Each concern is independently readable and testable.
- `applyCookTime()` return type is `int` (items cooked count) rather than `boolean`,
  used for both the notification NBT tag and the particle packet gate.
- NBT versioning added: `everfurnace_version` written on every save. Currently at
  version `1`. Future releases can key migrations off this value.
- `everfurnace_pendingNotification` (int) stored on furnace persistent NBT data;
  cleared on first open by a player after catch-up.
